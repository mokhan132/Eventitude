# Eventitude â€” Full-Stack Event Management Platform

## Description
Eventitude is a full-stack event management web application. It allows users to register an account, create events, browse available events, join as attendees, and participate in live Q&A through a question and voting feature.

The project demonstrates practical skills in **Vue.js**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **JWT-based authentication**, and **SQLite database management**.  
The server environment and database were provided as part of the **project infrastructure**; all backend logic, routes, authentication, and front-end functionality were planned and implemented by me.

---

## Key Features
- Single-page application (SPA) built with **Vue.js** and **Vue Router**
- User registration and login with secure **JWT** session management
- Event creation, editing, and deletion
- Attendee registration with capacity limits
- Live Q&A: users can submit questions for an event, upvote/downvote, and event hosts can moderate questions
- **SQLite** database for persistent user and event data

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vue.js, Vue Router, Axios
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, JWT, SQLite
- **Other:** RESTful APIs, custom authentication middleware, CRUD operations

## How to Run
ðŸ“Œ *Note:* This project was developed in an environment with a pre-configured server and database.  
A sample local version can be run by:
1. Cloning the repository
2. Installing dependencies (`npm install` for backend and frontend)
3. Running the server (`node server.js`) and client (`npm run serve`)

## Status
This project demonstrates my practical full-stack web development skills and experience integrating front-end and back-end technologies.
